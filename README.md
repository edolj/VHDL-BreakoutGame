# VHDL-BreakoutGame

This is an end project for my college subject and was done at the start of year 2017. It represents the game "Breakout". This project is created in VHDL language. It is hardware description language.

This project was made for specific board. It works only with Digilent Nexys 2 Spartan 3E board, but with a few minor changes it can also work with Digilent Nexys 4 board. Game is displayed via VGA protocol and only works in 640x480 resolution.

The programming in VHDL was on ISE WebPACK 14.7 Design Suite.
